/**
 * Open/Close Principle (OCP)
 *  - Design your code to be open for extension but close for
 *  modification. This means that when you need to add new features
 *  or modify existing behavior, you should do so by extending
 *  or creating new classes, rather than modifying the existing ones.
 *
 *  - Use dependency injection (DI) to inject dependency into your class.
 *  This make is easier to swap implementation and extend functionality
 *  without modifying the existing code.
